"Quantum computers are the next leap forward in computing power. 
Using the power of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems,
quantum computers can do things that even the biggest and best classic supercomputers in the world cannot.
This nascent technology creates multidimensional spaces to represent very large problems. 
Quantum computers can even perform certain tasks in about one second that would take a classic supercomputer a week to perform. 
Given the technology's potential, it's certainly understandable why investors are excited about the future of quantum computing."
